Total Players = 6 ( Including You)

Ask user to input the total number of rounds

Then, randomly Players will get the Position/Status i.e "King, Queen, Minister, Police, Cook and Thief"

Now, if you are police, then you need to find out who is thief. And if you missed, then you will get Zero and your actual points will awarded to the theif.

And same happens with the Player 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ( Computer automatically picks any random person excluding themself)

At the end, calculate total marks and declare winner
